# The_Hacks
For the corporate competition Cognizant Prodigi Academia 2022, the BE-U project was developed.
The "Connected Consumer Experience" problem statement was selected by our team, The Hacks, and we were awarded best solution.
The constraints include:Â 
1. Customer hyper-personalization
2. Direct interaction with consumers
3. Programmes for consumer loyalty
Our goal is to create a D2C platform that satisfies all three requirements.

Our solution

The key idea we had in our mind was to enhance the feature of hyper personalization.
What if we ask questions to our users and then recommend the required products for them?
This question led us to the unique feature of our website.
