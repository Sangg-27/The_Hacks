# The_Hacks
For the corporate competition Cognizant Prodigi Academia 2022, the BE-U project was developed.
The "Connected Consumer Experience" problem statement was selected by our team, The Hacks, and we were awarded best solution.
The constraints include:Â 
1. Customer hyper-personalization
2. Direct interaction with consumers
3. Programmes for consumer loyalty
Our goal is to create a D2C platform that satisfies all three requirements.
